### For my Joint Savings Account assignment I used `Remix`
* Created the contract *JointSavings*
* Created functions *withdraw*, *deposit*, *setAccounts*, *external payable {}*
* Compiled the code and then deployed the contract


## Set the accounts for the purpose of testing the contract and the *setAccounts*
